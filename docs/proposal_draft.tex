\section{Introduction}

The project we will be working on is remote pc controller. The main idea of this project is to control a computer remotely by another computer. The computers will be connected through LAN. We have to send signals to control the functions of mouse and keyboard. \\

\section{Motivation}

The concept of this project comes from the idea of solving a computer's problem remotely. It is an interesting project to work on as numerous new features have to be worked upon. Through this project we will get a clear concept about different networking protocol and network programming. %modification needed
Similar programs are available (i.e. TeamViewer).
